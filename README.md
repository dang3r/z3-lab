# Z3 Lab

This project contains experiments and thoughts on the [Z3 SMT Solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

# Installation

Clone the github repository and install the z3 python library

```
$ git clone git@github.com:dang3r/z3-lab.git
$ cd z3-lab
$ pip3 install z3-solver

```

# Usage

To run the existing experiments, run `python3 experiments.py`

# Motivation

I am currently taking the Udacity AI Nanodegree. It contained exercises on the Z3 SMT solver
which inspired me to learn more.

Some of the existing code in `epxriments.py` was taken from the python tutorial provided
by the z3 team at https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/tree/master/examples/python/tutorial/jupyter
